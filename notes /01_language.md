# Language as World and Encarnation

Language is not a neutral tool.
It is an encarnation of the world in which a being dwells.

Language carries:
- Environment
- Geography
- Relation
- Memory
- Mode of being

Myth must be read phenomenologically through language,
not as abstract narrative but as situated speech.
